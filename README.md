# C-Maps: Progressive Web App for Carbon Footprint and Emission Monitoring

C-Maps is a progressive web application designed to track and monitor carbon footprints and emissions using geospatial technology. Developed by the Greenovate Team from Universitas Gadjah Mada, C-Maps provides real-time data on emissions across various regions in Indonesia, with a focus on supporting sustainable development and responsible environmental management.

C-Maps categorizes CO and CO₂ emissions by source, including:
- **Transportation**
- **Offices & Residential**

Emission data is visualized over time, showing that transportation is currently the largest contributor to CO₂ levels.

## Application Development Roadmap
- **Short-term**: Optimize loading speed for better user experience.
- **Medium-term**: Regular updates and maintenance.
- **Long-term**: API integration, hybrid app conversion, and advanced hosting.
